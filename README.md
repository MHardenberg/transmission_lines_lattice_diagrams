# transmission_lines_lattice_diagrams
Some implementations for making lattice diagrams for transmission lines.

The aim is to simulate electrical transmission lines' reflections upon switching them. THe approach is based on the lattica diagram method and generalized for two serial transmission lines.
The method can be evaluated both as voltage reflections (for open at near end) and current (open at far end) configurations.
